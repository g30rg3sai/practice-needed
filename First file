This is the first line for the learning the github

1) register in github

2) diff between git and github

git - version control software

github - a webserver which allow people yo create a multiple repositories and providing them the GIT- version control and colloboration service


Here repository means like a project where you can create multiple projects(repositories) in github

one more thing,
commit - it means like a save(save the changes is commit the changes in github)



this is editing in the master just to see how it will react to the child 2 branch when i merget he pull request

this is just a another child2 to practice how the things work if i add the same line in the master

 this is child one created the child branch to get away after getting new idea its like away from main idea so created the branch if evryone likes my idea i will give a pull request(merge) to the master


This is for fork and pull request to the master file in the different account, just to try how the pull request works and one more thing if it is same account it is merge account 

ok so now the issue tab in the Github

we can create a new issue if you would like to add something, or provide an idea or if you have any issues with the application you can provide the problem with the screen shot

if you want to close the issue by just adding the commit info like this fixes #4 , the issue will close automatically

As already we know that we can add the hash value of the commit in the issue section
 

 now i am editing this file from the git which is in my computer by cloning--- git clone URL then go to directory and check status to know evrything fine

after adding user name and emial you can verify using git config --list

git log to view the changes

to make changes we need to know about the remote so -- git remote ------ it provies remote name here it is origin

if you enter git remote -v ------------it will gives us the origin info that is our cloned github link

then you can enter git push origin -------- to push data to the github repository then it will ask you to login------ thats it it will add to your repository
